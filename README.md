# ZiGate JN5169 coordinator firmware

Public, standalone firmware tree for a **ZiGate v1 (JN5169)** Zigbee
**coordinator**, built on the **NXP JN-SW-4170 v2395** SDK, carrying the
OpenLumi ZiGate v3.23 application and a versioned diagnostic and bounded
local-control protocol.

The firmware also contains a typed, snapshot-based OCB **metadata export**
subset (`0x0D18`..`0x0D1C`). It deliberately does not export keys, implement
restore, or claim BackupCapable. See
[`docs/OCB_UART_ABI.md`](docs/OCB_UART_ABI.md).

A separate default-off
`OCB_KEY_EXPORT_RESTORE_EXPERIMENTAL=1` build adds trusted-local-UART network
and link-key export with a 30-second nonce confirmation that is explicitly
**not authentication**. Restore remains blocked and BackupCapable remains
clear because v2395 does not expose flash-TCLK counters or atomic rollback.

> Status: **rev18 is a source/build candidate and has not been hardware-
> qualified.** It changes the current TX-power PDM record ID only; rev17
> remains the exact hardware-qualified artifact for the RODRET reset defect
> and its network/TX-power paths. Typed OCB restore remains unimplemented and
> experimental key export remains unqualified. See
> [`docs/MIGRATION_STATUS.md`](docs/MIGRATION_STATUS.md).

The custom diagnostic ABI is protocol **1.2**, build **rev 18**. Host-visible
custom commands are capability-negotiated through `0x0D0F`/`0x8D0F`; see
[`docs/DIAGNOSTIC_ABI_MANUFACTURER_CODE.md`](docs/DIAGNOSTIC_ABI_MANUFACTURER_CODE.md)
and
[`docs/DIAGNOSTIC_ABI_GREEN_POWER.md`](docs/DIAGNOSTIC_ABI_GREEN_POWER.md),
which specifies the negotiated Green Power proxy commissioning command
`0x0D17`/`0x8D17` added in rev 7 and re-encoded in rev 8 with a per-request
32-bit transaction id (request 7 bytes, response 9 bytes) so a late response from a
timed-out request can never be mistaken for the answer to the next one. The
protocol version is unchanged at 1.2; every other command encoding is
unchanged.

### UART command inventory

All custom multi-byte fields are big-endian. Payload lengths exclude ZiGate
framing and the trailing LQI byte streamed by `vSL_WriteMessage()`. Struct version is
`1` unless stated otherwise.

| Request → response | Payload and availability |
|---|---|
| `0x0D00` → no `0x8D00` | Removed TCLK diagnostic. Any request receives only outer `0x8000` UNHANDLED_COMMAND. |
| `0x0D0F` → `0x8D0F` | Capability negotiation: req 10 (`"ZGHX", host_major, host_minor, nonce:u32`); rsp 24 (`"ZGHX", nonce, proto 1.2, build_id:u32, capabilities:u64, max_payload:u16`). |
| `0x0D12` → `0x8D12` | Local APS group operation: req 5; rsp 9. |
| `0x0D13` → `0x8D13` | Local APS group list: req 4; rsp `7 + rows`, each row `index:u8, group:u16, endpoint_count:u8, endpoints[]`, at most 5 rows and 16 endpoints per row. |
| `0x0D14` → `0x8D14` | Local neighbour page: req 4; rsp `7 + 23*n`, `n <= 8`. |
| `0x0D15` → `0x8D15` | Local route page: req 4; rsp `7 + 9*n`, `n <= 16`. |
| `0x0D16` → `0x8D16` | Global Node Descriptor manufacturer-code GET/SET/RESTORE_DEFAULT: req 4; rsp 6. Default is `0x1147`; not persisted. |
| `0x0D17` → `0x8D17` | GP proxy commissioning, only with `CLD_GREENPOWER`: req 7 and rsp 9 with echoed `transaction_id:u32`. |
| `0x0D18` → `0x8D18` | Typed OCB metadata EXPORT_BEGIN: req 6; rsp 19. Default-on with `OCB_TYPED_SUPPORT=1`. |
| `0x0D19` → `0x8D19` | Typed OCB EXPORT_CORE: req 10; rsp 55. |
| `0x0D1A` → `0x8D1A` | Typed OCB LINK_KEY_BY_EUI placeholder: req 18; rsp 24 with FIELD_UNAVAILABLE and key length zero. |
| `0x0D1B` → `0x8D1B` | Typed OCB EXPORT_END: req 10; rsp 16. |
| `0x0D1C` → `0x8D1C` | Typed OCB STATUS: req 10; rsp 20. |
| `0x0D1F` → `0x8D1F` | General diagnostics: empty request; 47-byte response. TCLK fields are `0xFF` with TCLK_UNAVAILABLE set. |
| `0x0D20`…`0x0D2A` → `0x8D20`…`0x8D2A` | Default-off experimental trusted-UART key export and explicit restore-unavailable stubs. Exact per-opcode layouts are in [`docs/OCB_UART_ABI.md`](docs/OCB_UART_ABI.md). |
| `0x0D2B` → `0x8D2B` | Capability-gated boot reset snapshot: empty req; rsp 6 (`version, status, flags, SYSCTRL-status:u16, exception_reason`). See [`docs/RESET_DIAGNOSTIC_ABI.md`](docs/RESET_DIAGNOSTIC_ABI.md). |
| `0x0D2C` → `0x8D2C` | Capability-gated retained exception context: empty req; rsp 22 (`version, status, reason, flags, SYSCTRL-status:u16, EPCR:u32, EEAR:u32, SP:u32, LR:u32`). |
| `0x0806` → `0x8806` | Legacy TX SET: req 1; successful rsp 2 (`six_bit_code, legacy_mapped_level`). Also emits outer `0x8000`; failed SET emits no `0x8806`. |
| `0x0807` → `0x8807` | Legacy TX GET: empty req; successful rsp 2 with the same representation, plus outer `0x8000`. |
| `0x0B00` → `0x8B00`, `0x0B01` → `0x8B01`, `0x0B02` | Unsafe legacy raw-PDM dump/restore/activate commands. Not dispatched by default; available only with `INSECURE_DEV_RAW_PDM=1` and `OCB_TYPED_SUPPORT=0`. |

Diagnostic capability bits are: groups bit 0, neighbours bit 1, routes bit 2,
GP commissioning bit 3 when compiled, TX power bit 9, manufacturer-code
control bit 10, general diagnostics bit 14, typed OCB metadata bit 15 when
compiled, experimental key export bit 16 when compiled, and boot reset
summary diagnostics bit 18 and reset-context bit 19. Reserved
BackupCapable bit 17 is always clear. The wrapper's default GP + typed-OCB
build advertises `0x00000000000CC60F` and computes
`DIAG_FW_BUILD_ID=0x010DC53E`. Enabling experimental export adds bit 16,
yielding `0x00000000000DC60F` and build ID `0x010CC53E`. Bit 18 guarantees
only `0x0D2B`; bit 19 independently guarantees `0x0D2C`. These IDs identify
source constants, not hardware qualification.

Within the pre-existing diagnostic ABI, rev 9 changed no command encoding. It
restores endpoint 1's **raw-NCP
transmit allowlist**: physical HIL showed the ZPS APS layer uses an endpoint's
`OutputClusters` list to authorize *host-originated raw `0x0530` transmissions*
— a Power Configuration `0x0001` read was rejected locally with APS `0xA3`
`ILLEGAL_REQUEST` while Basic `0x0000` succeeded only because Basic was listed.
In an NCP those entries describe what the host+firmware pair can originate, so
Power Configuration, Multistate Input, OTA, Thermostat UI, Illuminance Level
Sensing, Pressure, Occupancy and Electrical Measurement are listed again. This
is const/flash descriptor data only: no ZCL runtime instances were added and
`.data`/`.bss` are unchanged. See
[`docs/MIGRATION_STATUS.md`](docs/MIGRATION_STATUS.md).

Rev 9 also made the endpoint-1 **Time server (`0x000A`) read-only over
Zigbee**. The UTC value is host-owned: it is written only by
`E_SL_MSG_SET_TIMESERVER` (`0x0016`) and the firmware's 1 Hz increment, and
read by `E_SL_MSG_GET_TIMESERVER` (`0x0017`) and remote ZCL *reads*. Remote ZCL
*Write Attributes* to cluster `0x000A` are refused with ZCL status `0x7e`
NOT_AUTHORIZED **before** the attribute is modified, including in `RAW_MODE_ON`.
Without this, registering the Time server for network reads would also have let
any node holding only the network key rewrite the clock the host reads back —
the cluster's `E_ZCL_SECURITY_APPLINK` requirement is clamped to network-level
security by the ZCL core in this build. `.text` +60 B, `.data`/`.bss` unchanged.
Details and the machine-checked invariants are in
[`docs/MIGRATION_STATUS.md`](docs/MIGRATION_STATUS.md) ("Time cluster
ownership").

### TX-power fields: two intentionally different representations

`0x8D1F` (general diagnostics) reports the **canonical raw six-bit register
code** in both unsigned TX bytes. The legacy `0x8806`/`0x8807` frames keep
`byte0` = the same six-bit code but `byte1` = the **legacy mapped level**.
From rev 6 these two **do not agree, by design** — neither is changed for the
sake of matching the other. Key the `0x8D1F` interpretation off build
revision ≥ 6 via `DIAG_FW_BUILD_ID`.

A successful legacy SET (`0x0806`) is persisted in the application PDM. Rev 10
observes every `ZPS_EVENT_NWK_STARTED` in `APP_vBdbCallback` before endpoint
routing, then defers application until `bdb_taskBDB()` has returned to the main
loop. This removes the rev9 callback-ordering assumption that failed physical
reset testing. The validated record is cached, so subsequent network starts do
not reread or write PDM. A new or changed record is read back and fully
validated before SET reports success. GET (`0x0807`) and both response
encodings are otherwise unchanged.
The record is explicitly packed and fixed at five bytes (`TX`, format version
2, code, CRC-8) and is stored directly at application PDM ID `0x0011`.
Rev9/rev10 firmware using an incompatible ABI-padded record at that ID was
experimental and was never distributed in a product variant, so the current
firmware does not reserve another ID or implement migration. Test devices
carrying the experimental record must be factory-reset. Product variants need
no backward-compatibility path.
The accepted values remain exactly `0x00..0x0A` and `0x20..0x3F`. They are
native signed six-bit MiniMac codes (`0x20..0x3F` represent −32..−1), **not
calibrated dBm measurements**. Invalid, clamped, non-round-trippable, corrupt,
or unknown PDM record versions are never applied. Repeated SETs of the already
valid persisted code do not rewrite EEPROM.

## Target build cell

```
JN5169 / JN516x / COORDINATOR / BAUD=115200
GP_SUPPORT=1  LEGACY=1  R23_UPDATES=0  WWAH=0  OTA=0  TRACE=0
DEBUG=NONE  DISABLE_LTO=1  APP_AHI_CONTROL=1
INSECURE_DEV_RAW_PDM=0  OCB_TYPED_SUPPORT=1
OCB_KEY_EXPORT_RESTORE_EXPERIMENTAL=0
```

`OTA=0` is currently a legacy build-cell label, not a feature switch:
`zcl_options.h` still defines `CLD_OTA`/`OTA_SERVER`, the OTA sources are
compiled, and endpoint 1 advertises the OTA server. Do not treat this image as
OTA-disabled.

## Building

Requirements (host):

- BA2 toolchain (`ba-elf-gcc 4.7.4`, binutils 2.22). Not vendored — set
  `TOOLCHAIN_ROOT` to the directory containing `ba-elf-ba2/bin/`.
- `python3` with `xmltodict==0.13.0` and `lxml` for the SDK config generators.
  A repo-local venv is used automatically if present:

  ```sh
  python3 -m venv .venv
  .venv/bin/pip install "xmltodict==0.13.0" lxml
  ```

Then:

```sh
# defaults to the target build cell above
TOOLCHAIN_ROOT=/path/to/toolchain sh scripts/build.sh clean
TOOLCHAIN_ROOT=/path/to/toolchain sh scripts/build.sh all
```

Every build variable can be overridden from the environment (e.g.
`GP_SUPPORT=0 BAUD=1000000 sh scripts/build.sh all`).

Relevant non-default builds are explicit:

```sh
# Default-off trusted-local-UART key export; restore still returns unsupported.
OCB_KEY_EXPORT_RESTORE_EXPERIMENTAL=1 sh scripts/build.sh all

# No typed OCB commands or OCB capability bits.
OCB_TYPED_SUPPORT=0 sh scripts/build.sh all

# Insecure bench-only legacy raw-PDM commands; incompatible with typed OCB.
OCB_TYPED_SUPPORT=0 INSECURE_DEV_RAW_PDM=1 sh scripts/build.sh all
```

The Makefile rejects experimental OCB without typed OCB and rejects raw PDM
with either typed or experimental OCB.

Reproducibility: the wrapper pins `LC_ALL=C`, `TZ=UTC`, and
`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`.

No CI workflow is committed in this repository. Run `scripts/check.sh` and the
clean build locally before release. Only the flashable BIN should be required
to be byte-identical across build hosts; ELF debug metadata can be
host-dependent.

The published rev9/db6f8f2 wrapper-default build reported
`text=255592 data=2104 bss=30421`, with 244 bytes between
`_minimum_heap_end=0x0400679c` and
`_stack_low_water_mark=0x04006890`:

```
BIN sha256 f17777bec16acd8f1586e56d5a3695f12c381603f634fee15f26859d7d1be6e0
ELF sha256 23d25e6b6968f2bcfa56393770e6184e9904d6ea6557e73484f8ae826ed378e1
```

Physical HIL disproved its documented TX persistence: SET 7 round-tripped
before adapter restart, but GET returned the default code 8 afterward. The
rev9 documentation therefore overclaimed persistence, and that hash must not
be cited as qualification for it.

The historical rev10 replacement clean-build result is
`text=255696 data=2104 bss=30421`, with the same 244-byte linker margin:

```
BIN sha256 08224db07767e3409d6ea06c6cd8adf8774a9e861292fda0d350e930aae94f74
ELF sha256 e1f67c5e721f2f190e833af15f1d3ab69c07d427a4fb8923a8dccdd5589f930e
```

Two clean local builds produced those rev10 hashes. Physical HIL on a device
carrying rev9's old `0x0011` record showed that SET failed closed with status 1,
so this artifact is also not a valid persistence release. These rev9/rev10
images and their incompatible record were test-only and were never distributed
in a product variant.

The historical rev11 clean-build result is:

```
text=255696 data=2104 bss=30421; linker RAM margin=244 bytes
BIN sha256 a704ba590c4a03e55be889d01c83b77c3491a09b708a8bca507b1829631b026e
ELF sha256 19d8192a4e98c35a0189cf8381b3c849d0bbd7a290202658b082090ce19b1bb6
```

Two clean local builds produced those rev11 hashes. This is build evidence,
not persistence HIL qualification.

Rev12 preserves the packed v2 TX-power validation/readback logic and adds the bounded
raw-ZDP, immutable SerialLink TX, strict raw-APS parser, and reset-diagnostic
changes described above. Two clean pinned-BA2 builds produced:

```
text=256032 data=2104 bss=30421; linker RAM margin=244 bytes
BIN size 258144 bytes
BIN sha256 38c3fbe2ccdfe2956130d01a2d470ab7a99424bfe5005f5304144a0f13c30a95
ELF sha256 125ab9c9eef30b6a74ab87512597a8fd953b0ce8ea2f5195aa8fca3f3c5d9c5f
DIAG_FW_BUILD_ID=0x0105C520
```

Rev12 was flashed and preserved the existing network, but TX persistence HIL
failed because the first GET after restart could precede the asynchronous
NWK_STARTED restore.

Rev13 schedules an initial restore immediately after `BDB_vStart()` while
retaining the later NWK_STARTED restore. Two clean pinned-BA2 builds produced:

```
text=256036 data=2104 bss=30421; linker RAM margin=244 bytes
BIN size 258148 bytes
BIN sha256 a510aaba81c320a26a7de76428e7231fc91466bddd990087c104c157a41ce96b
ELF sha256 ff3d310e64fa354f54fccf80a60007bbd13f6bb02dd27f6db07c4175abbc7dd5
DIAG_FW_BUILD_ID=0x0105C521
```

HIL of this exact rev13 BIN proved TX power 7 survives both a full power cycle
and a soft adapter restart. The same HIL exposed an unresolved software-reset
storm during an IKEA RODRET Active Endpoints interview.

Rev14 retains a guarded reset reason across software reset without writing PDM
or changing the six-byte `0x8D2B` response:

```
text=256308 data=2104 bss=30437; linker RAM margin=228 bytes
BIN size 258420 bytes
BIN sha256 5aeeaf1b91139bbae29f8f452db8f70fe921315cc378176610ec2027ecca6ab4
ELF sha256 3d98888f0f1e72e303ac5298efd002d24c2d2d26705cb2f78a5dfaeafffed79e
DIAG_FW_BUILD_ID=0x0105C522
```

Rev14 was flashed successfully. TX power 7 remained persistent, and RODRET
interview HIL identified the repeated resets as bus errors. It did not
localise or resolve the faulting instruction.

Rev14 HIL retained reason `1` across every reproduced RODRET interview reset,
proving the storm enters the JN5169 bus-error handler. Rev15 adds the fault
register context needed to map that exception to the exact ELF instruction:

```
text=256776 data=2104 bss=30469; linker RAM margin=196 bytes
BIN size 258888 bytes
BIN sha256 f052390fa76e520fbcc51866d3e11c9cee60f33d9f80c31dd7358c751ccbf073
ELF sha256 73d960a5820701638d7873ad0f2701365d816b41cb88a3b09ff1999b1d81d23e
DIAG_FW_BUILD_ID=0x0105C523
```

This is software/build evidence only; rev15 has not been flashed or
hardware-qualified.

Rev16 changes only capability negotiation and revision metadata: shipped bit
18 continues to guarantee `0x0D2B`, while new bit 19 independently guarantees
`0x0D2C`. Neither payload layout changed.

```
text=256780 data=2104 bss=30469; linker RAM margin=196 bytes
BIN size 258892 bytes
BIN sha256 4910a67aaeeb10fef7a5ad4e79065eeb2a1f3bc54677b342b94731ac525424fd

DIAG_FW_BUILD_ID=0x010DC53C
```

Rev16 was flashed and reproduced the RODRET reset storm. Its retained context
localized every reset to a bus error in the v2395 ZPS
`bDuplicateCheck()` implementation.

Rev17 adds a narrow linker wrapper around `zps_psFindKeyDescr()`. Some stock
early failure paths leave its output index untouched when no key descriptor is
found, while `bDuplicateCheck()` still uses that value to address the incoming
frame-counter array. GCC had reused the same stack slot for the packet CRC,
producing an effectively random index. Rev17 sets the index to zero whenever
the lookup returns `NULL`; successful key lookup, key selection, and the replay
decision remain unchanged. On the keyless path, the duplicate-table snapshot
now records the valid slot-zero counter instead of reading an undefined
address.

Two clean pinned-toolchain builds produced the same BIN and ELF hashes:

```
text=256808 data=2104 bss=30469; linker RAM margin=196 bytes
BIN size 258920 bytes
BIN sha256 025e033cb73f8e68c57d41263c7b557888c49afa774c695aacce18dd053eecb4
ELF sha256 4c9fedc3c01412a68817b03587f38868b33aef7938df1df924f976f237936309
DIAG_FW_BUILD_ID=0x010DC53D
```

The shipped NOLTO ELF contains `__wrap_zps_psFindKeyDescr`, and the call in
`bDuplicateCheck()` targets that wrapper. The exact BIN above was flashed on a
ZiGate v1 JN5169. It preserved PAN `0x6ADA`, channel 15 and TX power `7`.
Two awake RODRET interviews received Node Descriptor `0x8002`, Active
Endpoints `0x8005`, Simple Descriptor `0x8004`, completed Basic reads, and
finished with one endpoint. No new `0x8006` restart indication appeared, and
the retained reset context stayed at the expected host-reset reason `0x10`.

Rev18 changes the current packed TX-power v2 record ID to `0x0011` and removes
the test-only reserved/replacement-ID workaround. Because the incompatible
rev9/rev10 record was never distributed in a product variant, no migration is
implemented; affected test devices may be factory-reset. The UART protocol,
capability bitmap, packed record validation, save readback, and TX restore
ordering are unchanged. One clean pinned-toolchain build produced:

```
text=256808 data=2104 bss=30469; linker RAM margin=196 bytes
BIN size 258920 bytes
BIN sha256 421893c636aded7204889e6b8bd85206312b1de0b0ed7b5507dbbd2d18d77d36
ELF sha256 6b9898ca40d5709623eafb92f015d0d5ffd8aaacf571989b7d059cbaeb35cad7
DIAG_FW_BUILD_ID=0x010DC53E
```

This is build evidence only; rev18 has not been hardware-qualified.

## Provenance & licensing

NXP SDK files retain their original license headers. OpenLumi application code
and local changes remain identifiable through the preserved Git history. See
`LICENSES/`.

## Safety

This tree targets a coordinator that speaks a host serial protocol. Hardware
qualification is revision-specific: use the explicit HIL status beside each
artifact above, and do not treat a successful build as deployment validation.
