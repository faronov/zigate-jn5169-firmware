/****************************************************************************
 *
 * MODULE:  custom_diag.h
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *   Compact, versioned UART diagnostic and bounded local-control extension
 *   for the ZiGate JN5169 ZigbeeNodeControlBridge coordinator firmware.
 *
 *   This module is strictly additive. It does not modify, replace or expand
 *   any stock SerialLink command and never performs raw PDM or credential-
 *   flash access. The production/default build exposes no key material.
 *   Mutating operations are limited to the explicitly negotiated local APS
 *   group, Node Descriptor manufacturer-code, and GP commissioning controls.
 *   Only the following capabilities are implemented and advertised:
 *
 *     - Capability negotiation           (0x0D0F / 0x8D0F)
 *     - General read-only diagnostics    (0x0D1F / 0x8D1F)
 *     - Paginated local neighbour table  (0x0D14 / 0x8D14)
 *     - Paginated local route table      (0x0D15 / 0x8D15)
 *     - Local APS group operation        (0x0D12 / 0x8D12)
 *     - Local APS group paginated list   (0x0D13 / 0x8D13)
 *     - Node Descriptor manufacturer code (0x0D16 / 0x8D16)
 *     - Local GP proxy commissioning     (0x0D17 / 0x8D17)
 *     - Typed OCB metadata export        (0x0D18..0x0D1C)
 *     - Boot reset-cause snapshot        (0x0D2B / 0x8D2B)
 *
 *   All wire fields are serialised individually in big-endian order using the
 *   ZNC_BUF_* macros. No C structure is ever cast onto the wire, so the wire
 *   ABI is independent of BA GCC 4.7.4 struct layout.
 *
 *   vSL_WriteMessage() streams the trailing link-quality byte without changing
 *   or extending the caller-supplied payload.

/* Custom diagnostic protocol version (independent of the stock firmware
 * version). Bump the minor for backward-compatible field additions and the
 * major for incompatible wire changes.
 *
 * 1.1 revises paginated responses (7-byte prefix with an explicit next_index
 * cursor) and adds a physical table index to each group-list row, so it is not
 * wire-compatible with the never-released 1.0 draft.
 *
 * 1.2 (rev4+) changes TX-power wire semantics: the stock 0x8806/0x8807 first
 * application byte and the custom general-diag (0x0D1F/0x8D1F) TX-power fields
 * now carry the canonical SIX-BIT code (GET & 0x3F) instead of the rev3 full
 * PIB byte with a phantom 0x40 tolerance bit, and SET rejects non-round-
 * trippable codes. Hosts must treat this as a wire-observable change. */

/* Explicit deterministic build revision. MUST be incremented whenever the
 * implementation changes in a way that should be observable through the
 * capability build id, even if version/protocol/capabilities are unchanged.
 *   rev 1: initial custom protocol.
 *   rev 2: NXP review fixes (TX power PIB handling, 0x8806 gating, 0xC4
 *          formation-failure status, group pagination index + next cursor,
 *          neighbour IEEE guard, endpoint-state validation, TCLK snapshot,
 *          reserved-flag rejection).
 *   rev 3: HIL fix - stock 0x8806/0x8807 first application byte is now the full
 *          PIB raw value (0x00..0x40) instead of the 6-bit masked level, so a
 *          valid raw of 0x40 is echoed intact; the second byte remains the
 *          legacy mapped value from the masked level. Custom general-diag TX
 *          fields (full raw / masked level / signed code) already matched.
 *          (Superseded from rev6: see the rev6 note on the deliberate 0x8D1F
 *          vs 0x8806/0x8807 byte1 divergence.)
 *   rev 4: rev3 TX semantics CORRECTED per HIL + MiniMac disassembly. 0x40 is
 *          NOT round-trippable (SET sign-extends low 6 bits to 0; GET returns a
 *          sign-extended i8). Canonical semantics: SET accepts only exact non-
 *          clamping codes 0x00..0x0A and 0x20..0x3F and rejects 0x0B..0x1F and
 *          0x40+; the 0x8806/0x8807 byte0 is now GET & 0x3F (canonical six-bit
 *          code) with byte1 the legacy mapped level; general-diag TX fields are
 *          [six-bit code][six-bit code][signed six-bit code]. Also: the 0x0D00
 *          TCLK diagnostic feature (crypto-path --wrap interposition + internal
 *          security-state export) was REMOVED as security-sensitive; the three
 *          general-diag TCLK bytes are now always NA with TCLK_UNAVAILABLE set.
 *          Green Power coordinator RAM footprint reduced.
 *   rev 5: advertise Green Power commissioning only in builds that actually
 *          include CLD_GREENPOWER. This is an additive capability bit; the
 *          1.2 wire structures and command encodings are unchanged.
 *   rev 6: make the general-diagnostics TX level match the canonical MiniMac
 *          PIB code already returned by TX GET. The protocol 1.2 layout and
 *          command encodings are unchanged.
 *          NOTE - this makes the 0x8D1F and 0x8806/0x8807 TX byte1 fields
 *          DIVERGE, deliberately and permanently:
 *            0x8D1F  byte0/byte1 = canonical raw six-bit register code
 *                    (GET & 0x3F), byte2 = signed six-bit code.
 *            0x8806/0x8807  byte0 = same six-bit code, byte1 = LEGACY MAPPED
 *                    level from the threshold ladder in app_Znc_cmds.c
 *                    (<=31 -> 0, <=39 -> 32, <=51 -> 20, else 9).
 *          rev4's note that the general-diag fields "already matched" the
 *          legacy mapping describes rev3/rev4 and is NO LONGER true for
 *          byte1 from rev6 onwards. The divergence is intentional: 0x8D1F is
 *          the canonical register view for diagnostics, 0x8806/0x8807 keep the
 *          legacy ZiGate semantics deployed hosts already parse. Neither is
 *          changed for the sake of consistency with the other; hosts key the
 *          0x8D1F interpretation off build revision >= 6.
 *   rev 7: add the negotiated Green Power proxy commissioning command
 *          (0x0D17/0x8D17). Capability bit 1<<3 is unchanged in value but is
 *          now asserted only when this handler is compiled in, so hosts that
 *          see the bit can rely on the command instead of an unmanaged raw
 *          0x0530 APS broadcast (which the rev6 HIL rejected with
 *          ZPS_APL_APS_E_NO_ACK, 0xA6). Additive, capability-gated ABI: the
 *          1.2 wire structures and every pre-existing command encoding are
 *          unchanged.
 *   rev 8: add an explicit per-request transaction id to the Green Power
 *          proxy commissioning command only (0x0D17 request 3 -> 7 bytes,
 *          0x8D17 response 5 -> 9 bytes). The superseded first rev8 draft
 *          used a one-byte transaction id and 4/6-byte wire structures; the
 *          final ABI uses a big-endian uint32 transaction id. The rev7
 *          encoding carried no
 *          correlation field, so a late 0x8D17 from a host request that had
 *          already timed out was structurally indistinguishable from the
 *          answer to the NEXT request and could be consumed by it, reporting
 *          a stale window state as the current one. The firmware now echoes
 *          the request's transaction id in every response it emits for a
 *          structurally valid request, so the host can reject anything it did
 *          not ask for. Protocol stays 1.2: 0x0D17/0x8D17 were introduced in
 *          rev7 and are gated behind capability bit 1<<3, so no shipped host
 *          can be using the rev7 encoding without re-negotiating the build id
 *          first. Every other command encoding is unchanged.
 *   rev 9: restore the endpoint-1 raw-NCP transmit allowlist after physical
 *          HIL. No wire format, command encoding or capability bit changes;
 *          this revision exists only so a host can tell, from the build id,
 *          whether the image it is talking to can originate the affected
 *          clusters at all. The rev6 descriptor pruning treated endpoint 1's
 *          OutputClusters as pure ZCL advertisement and removed every cluster
 *          without a local client instance. HIL shows the ZPS APS layer also
 *          uses that same list as the allowlist for RAW, host-originated
 *          transmissions (serial 0x0530): a Basic 0x0000 read succeeds only
 *          because Basic survived the pruning, while a Power Configuration
 *          0x0001 read or configure-reporting is rejected LOCALLY by the
 *          JN5169 with APS status 0xA3 (ZPS_APL_APS_E_ILLEGAL_REQUEST) before
 *          anything reaches the air. In an NCP the output-cluster list is
 *          therefore a truthful statement of what the host+NCP pair can
 *          originate, not a claim about firmware-resident ZCL clients, so
 *          rev9 re-adds the clusters the hub legitimately originates
 *          (Power Configuration, Multistate Input, OTA, Thermostat UI
 *          configuration, Illuminance Level Sensing, Pressure, Occupancy,
 *          Electrical Measurement). This is descriptor-only: const/flash,
 *          no new ZCL instances, no RAM.
 *          rev9 additionally makes the endpoint-1 Time server (cluster 0x000A)
 *          READ-ONLY OVER ZIGBEE. Registering that server for network reads
 *          also exposed a network WRITE path, because ZclTime.h marks
 *          Time/TimeStatus E_ZCL_AF_WR and the ZCL core clamps the cluster's
 *          E_ZCL_SECURITY_APPLINK requirement down to E_ZCL_SECURITY_NETWORK
 *          in this build; any node holding only the network key could have
 *          rewritten the clock the host reads back over 0x0017. Remote ZCL
 *          Write Attributes to 0x000A are now refused with ZCL status 0x7e
 *          NOT_AUTHORIZED before the attribute is modified, in raw mode too.
 *          Host SET/GET (0x0016/0x0017) and the 1 Hz increment are unchanged;
 *          this touches no host wire encoding, no capability bit and no
 *          protocol field, so it was folded into rev9 before publication,
 *          exactly as the superseded rev8 draft was.
 *   rev 10: repair TX-power restoration after physical HIL of published rev9
 *           showed that a successful persisted SET reverted to the default
 *           PIB value after adapter restart. NWK_STARTED is now observed in
 *           APP_vBdbCallback before endpoint routing, and application is
 *           deferred until bdb_taskBDB() has returned to the main loop.
 *           Successful PDM saves are also read back and fully validated before
 *           SET reports success. No UART command encoding or capability bit
 *           changes.
 *   rev 11: test-only workaround for an ABI-padded rev9 TX-power record.
 *           That experimental record was never distributed in a product
 *           variant and the workaround is superseded by rev18.
 *   rev 12: bypass the stock typed ZDP unpacker for raw-mode endpoint-0
 *           traffic except valid Device_annce, make SerialLink TX payloads
 *           immutable, reject malformed 0x0530 requests before APDU
 *           allocation, and add capability-gated boot reset diagnostics at
 *           0x0D2B/0x8D2B. Existing command layouts and protocol 1.2 remain
 *           unchanged.
 *   rev 13: schedule the persisted TX-power restore immediately after
 *           BDB_vStart() on restored-network boot, so the first serial GET
 *           cannot observe the default PIB value while NWK_STARTED is still
 *           queued. The later NWK_STARTED restore remains in place.
 *   rev 14: retain a checksum-guarded reset reason across software reset in
 *           a NOLOAD SRAM section. The existing 0x0D2B byte 5 now identifies
 *           synchronous exceptions and requested software resets instead of
 *           always returning unavailable. No PDM write or wire-size change.
 *   rev 15: extend the guarded reset marker with EPCR, EEAR, exception SP and
 *           interrupted LR. Add exact-length 0x0D2C/0x8D2C reset-context
 *           diagnostics; 0x8D2B remains six bytes.
 *   rev 16: advertise 0x0D2C/0x8D2C under independent capability bit 19.
 *           Bit 18 retains its shipped rev12 contract for 0x0D2B only. No
 *           request or response payload layout changes.
 *   rev 17: define the APS key-table output index when the v2395 key lookup
 *           returns no descriptor. The stock bDuplicateCheck() otherwise
 *           consumes the stale CRC stack slot as an incoming-frame-counter
 *           array index and raises a bus error. Key matching and replay
 *           decisions are unchanged; no wire layout or capability changes.
 *   rev 18: store the current packed five-byte TX-power v2 record directly at
 *           PDM ID 0x0011. The incompatible rev9/rev10 test record was never
 *           distributed in a product variant, so no migration or reserved
 *           replacement ID is required. Test devices may be factory-reset.
 *           Validation, save readback, wire layout and capabilities are
 *           unchanged.
 *
 *   The additive OCB metadata-export subset remains protocol 1.2 / rev18 for
 *   stock compatibility. Its separately negotiated capability bit changes
 *   DIAG_FW_BUILD_ID, so hosts can distinguish this image without changing
 *   any previously shipped command layout. */
