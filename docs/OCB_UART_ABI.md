# Typed Open Coordinator Backup UART extension

Status: the default `OCB_TYPED_SUPPORT=1` implementation is an **export-only
metadata subset; not BackupCapable**. OCB ABI version 1, schema version 1. It
is additive to ZiGate diagnostic protocol 1.2 / build revision 18 and does not
change stock command layouts.

All multi-byte integers are unsigned **big-endian**, matching the existing
`ZNC_BUF_*` custom protocol. ZiGate framing and the trailing LQI byte are not
included in the payload lengths below. Every accepted request first receives
the stock correlated-by-command `0x8000` status frame, followed by its typed
response.

## Security boundary

Production/default builds do not dispatch legacy raw-PDM commands
`0x0B00`/`0x8B00`, `0x0B01`/`0x8B01`, or `0x0B02`.
`INSECURE_DEV_RAW_PDM=1` is an explicit default-off bench option, and the
Makefile rejects it when `OCB_TYPED_SUPPORT=1`.

The default metadata implementation exports coordinator and Trust Center IEEE
addresses plus PAN/network identifiers and counters. It exports no network
key, APS link key, PDM record, arbitrary address lookup, memory range, or
serialized C structure. Link-key requests return `FIELD_UNAVAILABLE` and no
key bytes. Restore is not implemented or advertised. Consequently the
capability is named `OCB_METADATA_EXPORT`, not full OCB/BackupCapable.

Authenticated encryption and a board-specific physical-presence unlock were
not added to the default metadata subset, and the target has no qualified
button input. The separately compiled experimental ABI deliberately treats
direct local UART possession as trust, but its public nonce relation is not
physical presence or authentication. The default build's residual local-serial
threat is disclosure of network identifiers and live counters, not key
material. Rev18 changes no OCB behavior and has not been hardware-qualified.
The clean rev17 artifact had a 196-byte linker RAM margin.

## Compile-time gates and diagnostic capability bits

The build wrapper and Makefile defaults are:

```
OCB_TYPED_SUPPORT=1
OCB_KEY_EXPORT_RESTORE_EXPERIMENTAL=0
INSECURE_DEV_RAW_PDM=0
```

`OCB_TYPED_SUPPORT=1` dispatches `0x0D18`…`0x0D1C` and advertises diagnostic
capability bit 15. `OCB_KEY_EXPORT_RESTORE_EXPERIMENTAL=1` requires typed OCB,
compiles `ocb_experimental.c`, dispatches `0x0D20`…`0x0D2A`, and adds
diagnostic capability bit 16. It does not add bit 17. Raw PDM is incompatible
with either OCB mode. Reserved diagnostic bit 17 is the production-qualified
BackupCapable bit and is always clear.

With the wrapper defaults (`GP_SUPPORT=1`), the complete diagnostic capability
bitmap is `0x00000000000CC60F` and `DIAG_FW_BUILD_ID=0x010DC53E`.
Experimental export changes these to `0x00000000000DC60F` and
`0x010CC53E`. Bit 18 independently advertises reset summary `0x0D2B`; bit 19
independently advertises reset context `0x0D2C`. These are
negotiation identifiers, not qualification claims.

## Common fields

Except `EXPORT_BEGIN`, requests begin with:

```
abi_version:u8 | schema_version:u8 | transaction_id:u32 | session_id:u32
```

Responses begin with the same fields plus `status:u8`. Transaction and session
IDs are echoed exactly. `EXPORT_BEGIN` carries only versions and transaction
ID; firmware allocates a non-zero random session ID. One bounded snapshot can
be active at a time. The session is bound to both the `EXPORT_BEGIN`
transaction ID and allocated session ID, so all CORE/LINK_KEY/END/STATUS
requests for it must repeat both values. A new valid `EXPORT_BEGIN` atomically
supersedes a stale export-only snapshot, so loss of a host session cannot wedge
the ABI. `END` wipes the snapshot.

Statuses: `0 OK`, `1 BAD_VERSION`, `2 BAD_LENGTH` (reserved; exact-length
failures use outer `0x8000 INCORRECT_PARAMETERS` and emit no typed response),
`3 NO_SESSION`, `4 SESSION_MISMATCH`, `5 FIELD_UNAVAILABLE`, `6 BUSY`
(reserved/currently not emitted).

## Commands

| Request / response | Payload |
|---|---|
| `0x0D18` / `0x8D18` EXPORT_BEGIN | req 6: `ver, schema, txn`; rsp 19: common response + `capabilities:u32, fields:u32` |
| `0x0D19` / `0x8D19` EXPORT_CORE | req 10 common; rsp 55: common response + 44-byte core |
| `0x0D1A` / `0x8D1A` LINK_KEY_BY_EUI | req 18 common + `eui64`; rsp 24 common + `unavailable_field:u32, eui64, key_length:u8(0)` |
| `0x0D1B` / `0x8D1B` EXPORT_END | req 10 common; rsp 16 common + `record_count:u8(1), digest:u32` |
| `0x0D1C` / `0x8D1C` STATUS | req 10 common; rsp 20 common + `active:u8, fields:u32, digest:u32` |

OCB-local capabilities are `bit0 EXPORT_CORE`, `bit1 STATUS_DIGEST`.
`bit2 LINK_KEYS`, `bit3 RESTORE`, and `bit4 PHYSICAL_UNLOCK` are clear. These
OCB-local bits are fields in `0x8D18` and are distinct from the 64-bit
diagnostic capability bitmap negotiated by `0x8D0F`.

The CORE body is:

```
fields:u32
coordinator_ieee:u64
pan_id:u16
extended_pan_id:u64
channel:u8
channel_mask:u32
nwk_update_id:u8
security_level:u8
nwk_key_sequence:u8
authoritative_nwk_outgoing_counter:u32
aps_trust_center_ieee:u64
aps_flags:u8
aps_key_type:u8
```

`aps_flags`: bit0 designated coordinator, bit1 insecure join, bit2 decrypt
install code. A field is usable only when its validity bit is set. Field
validity bits are: coordinator IEEE bit 0, PAN ID bit 1, extended PAN ID bit 2,
channel bit 3, channel mask bit 4, NWK update ID bit 5, security level bit 6,
NWK key sequence bit 7, NWK outgoing counter bit 8, APS Trust Center address
bit 9, and APS state bit 10. Network key, link keys, and APS per-peer counters
are explicitly represented by permanently clear bits 16, 17, and 18; no
values are synthesized.

`digest` is 32-bit FNV-1a over the exact 44-byte canonical CORE body beginning
with `fields`, before framing. It is a readback/integrity check, **not**
authentication or encryption.

The snapshot reads typed live v2395 handles only. Compile-time checks pin the
generated coordinator role, one channel-mask entry, and 16-byte network-key
width. Runtime checks require exactly one channel-mask entry before marking it
valid.

## Unsupported restore

The default typed metadata subset has no
`RESTORE_BEGIN/CORE/LINK_KEY/VALIDATE/COMMIT/ABORT` ABI and no restore
capability bit. The available v2395 raw restore-point code relies on serialized
internal PDM layouts and cannot safely provide atomic rollback. It is
intentionally not adapted or exposed. No reboot or persistent mutation occurs
in this subset.

The experimental ABI reserves restore-shaped opcodes `0x0D24`…`0x0D28`, but
they are explicit non-mutating stubs. A valid, unlocked request receives typed
status `5 RESTORE_UNSUPPORTED`; locked and wrong-version requests receive
their corresponding statuses instead. No staging record, validation, commit,
rollback, reset, or reboot is performed.

## Experimental trusted-local-serial key export

`OCB_KEY_EXPORT_RESTORE_EXPERIMENTAL=1` builds an additional ABI that follows
the Z-Stack/EZSP trust model: possession of the direct local UART is treated as
physical trust. Authorization and destructive confirmation belong in the host.
The flag is default-off and cannot be combined with `INSECURE_DEV_RAW_PDM`.

There is **no cryptographic authentication or confidentiality**. The unlock is
a 30-second accidental-invocation guard:

1. Send CHALLENGE with a transaction ID.
2. Firmware returns a random nonce.
3. Send UNLOCK with
   `confirmation = nonce XOR transaction_id XOR 0x4f434221`.

The confirmation relation and constant are public. They are not a password,
MAC, signature, or proof of possession. AES was deliberately not applied:
without an independently provisioned secret or authenticated key agreement,
AES would only obscure bytes while providing no meaningful session security.

All experimental requests start with:

```
abi_version:u8 | schema_version:u8 | transaction_id:u32
```

All responses start with:

```
abi_version:u8 | schema_version:u8 | transaction_id:u32 | status:u8
```

All integers are big-endian.

Every exact-length request first receives outer `0x8000 SUCCESS`, followed by
the typed response. A wrong-length request receives only outer `0x8000
INCORRECT_PARAMETERS`. CHALLENGE binds the nonce to its transaction ID;
UNLOCK and all operations requiring unlock must use that same transaction ID.
A new CHALLENGE or failed UNLOCK clears prior unlock state. The 30-second timer
is checked against the JN5169 tick timer.

| Request / response | Exact payload |

| `0x0D20` / `0x8D20` CHALLENGE | req 6; rsp 16: prefix + `nonce:u32, ttl_seconds:u8, limitations:u32` |

Experimental typed statuses are `0 OK`, `1 BAD_VERSION`, `2 LOCKED`,
`3 NOT_FOUND`, `4 LAYOUT_MISMATCH`, and `5 RESTORE_UNSUPPORTED`.

Availability bits are: network key bit 0, NWK outgoing counter bit 1, TC/APS
link-key bytes bit 2, APS outgoing counter bit 3, APS incoming counter bit 4,
and EUI bit 5. Callers must use these bits; zero-filled unavailable fields are
not evidence that a key or counter exists.

LINK_KEY kinds are `0 default TC`, `1 live APS key-table index`, and `2 flash
TCLK index`. The generated target has one live APS key-table entry and 70 flash
TCLK slots. Missing entries return NOT_FOUND. Flash TCLK key bytes and EUI are
available, but their APS frame counters are not exposed by v2395, so the
counter availability bits remain clear.

Every temporary key array and the complete experimental TX buffer are wiped
through volatile stores after `vSL_WriteMessage()` returns.

### Capability truth

Diagnostic capability bit 16 means only **experimental trusted-serial key
export**. Reserved bit 17 is the production-qualified BackupCapable bit and is
never included in `DIAG_CAP_BITMAP`. Restore is not advertised. Experimental
builds report limitation bits for:

- bit 0: no authentication or encryption;
- bit 1: unavailable flash-TCLK counters;
- bit 2: no atomic rollback;
- bit 3: unqualified restore;
- bit 4: unsafe/unqualified coordinator IEEE override.

### v2395 symbol and layout evidence

The linked `libZPSAPL_LEGACY_JN516x.a` exports:

- `ZPS_vGetRestorePoint()` / `ZPS_vSetRestorePoint()`;
- `ZPS_vSetFixedNwkKey()`, `ZPS_vSetKeys()`, `zps_vSaveAllZpsRecords()`;
- `ZPS_bIsLinkKeyPresent()` and `zps_psFindKeyDescr()`;
- `ZPS_u64GetFlashMappedIeeeAddress()`;
- private-header-omitted `zps_bGetFlashCredential()`,
  `zps_eAddCredToFlash()`, and `zps_bAreCredPresent()`.

`zps_bGetFlashCredential()` is isolated behind the experimental flag using the
same exact declaration already present in `app_Znc_cmds.c`; no new guessed ABI
is introduced.

Generated `zps_gen.c` establishes:

- `s_asNwkSecMatSet[2]`;
- `s_keyPairTableStorage[4]`, with runtime key-table size 1;
- default TC key at storage slot 1;
- `au32IncomingFrameCounter[4]`;
- trust-center device table size 36;
- MAC table size 36;
- flash TCLK capacity configured by the application as 70.

Compile-time checks pin the 16-byte key widths and 24-byte legacy APS key
descriptor. Runtime checks require security-material count 2, APS key-table
size 1, MAC table size 36, all required pointers non-null, and the generated
legacy configuration before any key is copied.

The restore-point API can carry NWK security material and a live APS key map,
and PDM offers typed application records. However, v2395 provides no supported
per-flash-TCLK counter get/set API, while this coordinator stores up to 70
credentials in the separate TCLK flash area. Applying keys without preserving
and increasing those counters risks replay rejection or counter rollback.
Further, no atomic rollback contract is documented for a multi-record
restore-point/PDM/TCLK update, and IEEE override would mutate the live MAC PIB.
Therefore no staged record is created and COMMIT cannot mutate or reboot the
device. Partial restore is less safe than an explicit unsupported result.
