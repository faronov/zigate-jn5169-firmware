# Migration status — OpenLumi ZiGate v3.23 app → JN-SW-4170 v2395 SDK

Target build cell (the requested configuration):

```

Build entry point: `scripts/build.sh {clean|all}` (see header for overrides).

**Source/build-candidate status:** rev18 changes only the current TX-power PDM
record ID and has not been hardware-qualified. The exact rev17 BIN below
remains the targeted JN5169 HIL-qualified artifact for retained network/TX
power and the RODRET reset defect. This does not qualify optional OCB restore
or experimental key export. Older hashes and map figures are explicitly
labelled historical evidence and must not be advertised as rev18 results.

The current wrapper-default constants are diagnostic protocol 1.2, build
revision 18, capability bitmap `0x00000000000CC60F`, and
`DIAG_FW_BUILD_ID=0x010DC53E`. The default-off experimental key-export build
adds bit 16, producing bitmap `0x00000000000DC60F` and build ID
`0x010CC53E`. Reserved BackupCapable bit 17 remains clear in every build;
reset-summary capability bit 18 and reset-context capability bit 19 are set.

Current added/changed UART surfaces are:

- custom diagnostics/control `0x0D0F/0x8D0F`,
  `0x0D12/0x8D12`…`0x0D1C/0x8D1C`, `0x0D1F/0x8D1F`, and the additive
  reset snapshot `0x0D2B/0x8D2B`;
- removed/reserved TCLK request `0x0D00`, which emits only outer `0x8000`
  UNHANDLED_COMMAND and never `0x8D00`;
- default-off experimental `0x0D20/0x8D20`…`0x0D2A/0x8D2A`, with
  `0x0D24`…`0x0D28` implemented only as restore-unavailable stubs;
- legacy TX power `0x0806/0x8806` and `0x0807/0x8807`, retaining their
  two-byte value responses while adding exact-code validation and SET
  persistence;
- unsafe legacy raw-PDM `0x0B00/0x8B00`, `0x0B01/0x8B01`, and `0x0B02`,
  now absent from default dispatch and available only in the incompatible
  bench-only raw-PDM build.

Exact payload lengths and OCB status/capability domains are enumerated in
`README.md` and `docs/OCB_UART_ABI.md`.

```

An initial build and a subsequent clean regeneration produced the same hashes.
Physical HIL subsequently disproved the documented TX persistence: after SET 7
and exact GET 7, an adapter restart preserved network identity but GET returned
the default code 8. The hash above must not be presented as persistence
qualification. Rev10 replaces its callback-ordering assumption and requires a
new build and HIL result.

```

Two clean local builds produced those hashes. Physical HIL after flashing that
exact BIN onto a device carrying rev9's old eight-byte record at `0x0011`
showed that SET 7 failed closed with status 1 and GET remained at default code
8. The attempt to replace a differently sized record at the same ID therefore
does not work with this EEPROM PDM implementation. Rev10 is not a valid
persistence release. The rev9/rev10 images and incompatible record were
test-only and were never distributed in a product variant.

Two clean local builds produced those hashes. This exact BIN has not yet been
flashed or persistence-qualified.

```

Two clean builds produced the same BIN and ELF hashes. HIL of this exact image
proved TX power 7 survives both a full power cycle and a soft adapter restart.
The same HIL exposed an unresolved software-reset storm during an IKEA RODRET
Active Endpoints interview; watchdog and brownout flags remained clear.

Historical rev14 clean pinned-BA2 wrapper-default build:

```

DIAG_FW_BUILD_ID=0x0105C522
```

Rev14 keeps the six-byte reset diagnostic layout and uses byte 5 to
distinguish synchronous exceptions and requested software resets. Its
checksum-guarded marker occupies a 12-byte linker `NOLOAD` SRAM section and
never writes PDM. HIL consistently returned reason `1` during the RODRET
interview storm, proving entry through the bus-error handler but not yet
localising the faulting instruction.

Historical rev15 clean pinned-BA2 wrapper-default build:

```

DIAG_FW_BUILD_ID=0x0105C523
```

Rev15 expands the guarded `NOLOAD` marker to 28 bytes, captures bus-error
EPCR/EEAR/SP/LR before the handler's first call, and exposes them through the
new exact 22-byte `0x8D2C` response. Existing `0x8D2B` remains exactly six
bytes. This is build evidence only; rev15 has not been flashed or
HIL-qualified.

Historical rev16 clean pinned-BA2 wrapper-default build:

```
text=256780  data=2104  bss=30469

DIAG_FW_BUILD_ID=0x010DC53C
```

Rev16 leaves the `0x8D2B` six-byte and `0x8D2C` 22-byte payloads unchanged.
It preserves bit 18 as the shipped reset-summary capability and adds bit 19
solely for reset context, allowing hosts to distinguish rev12-14 from
context-capable firmware truthfully. The measurements above were recorded
before rev16 HIL.

Rev16 was subsequently flashed and used to localize the RODRET reset storm to
a bus error at `bDuplicateCheck()+0x2c8` in the prebuilt v2395 ZPS APS library.

HIL-qualified rev17 clean pinned-BA2 wrapper-default build:

```
text=256808  data=2104  bss=30469
_minimum_heap_end=0x040067cc
_stack_low_water_mark=0x04006890

DIAG_FW_BUILD_ID=0x010DC53D
```

Rev17 defines the key-table index only when `zps_psFindKeyDescr()` returns no
descriptor. Some v2395 early failure paths leave the output untouched, and
`bDuplicateCheck()` can then consume the stale CRC stack slot as an incoming-
frame-counter array index. Successful lookup and APS replay decisions are
unchanged; the keyless duplicate-table snapshot uses the valid slot-zero
counter instead of an undefined address.
The shipped NOLTO call targets the wrapper, and two clean builds produced the
same hashes. The exact BIN was flashed on ZiGate v1 JN5169 and preserved PAN
`0x6ADA`, channel 15 and TX power `7`. Two awake IKEA RODRET interviews
received `0x8002`, `0x8005` and `0x8004`, completed with one endpoint, and
produced no new `0x8006` restart indication. The retained reset context stayed
at the expected host-reset reason `0x10`.

Rev18 changes the current packed TX-power v2 record ID to `0x0011` and removes
the test-only reserved/replacement-ID workaround. One clean pinned-BA2
wrapper-default build produced:

```
text=256808  data=2104  bss=30469
_minimum_heap_end=0x040067cc
_stack_low_water_mark=0x04006890

DIAG_FW_BUILD_ID=0x010DC53E
```

The incompatible rev9/rev10 record was never distributed in a product
variant, so rev18 implements no migration; affected test devices may be
factory-reset. The packed record validation, save readback, restore ordering,
UART protocol and capability bitmap are unchanged. This is one clean-build
result, not a reproducibility or hardware-qualification claim.

## OCB firmware hardening and typed export status

The unauthenticated arbitrary-PDM UART handlers `0x0B00/0x0B01/0x0B02` are no
longer compiled or dispatched in production. They exist only behind the
default-off `INSECURE_DEV_RAW_PDM=1` bench switch; production
`OCB_TYPED_SUPPORT=1` and that switch are a Makefile error. `scripts/check.sh`
proves the defaults, dispatch guards, and rejected build-variable combination.

An additive ABI/schema 1 typed snapshot export is implemented at
`0x0D18`..`0x0D1C`. It exports coordinator/network identifiers, channel/mask,
update ID, security level, network-key sequence, the live authoritative NWK
outgoing frame counter, and limited APS/TC metadata. It exports no keys and
implements no restore; link keys, network key, APS per-peer counters, physical
unlock, and restore are explicitly unavailable and their capability bits are
clear. It therefore does **not** claim full OCB BackupCapable support. See
`docs/OCB_UART_ABI.md`.

In the historical pre-TX build, the metadata snapshot increased link-time BSS
by 72 bytes and shared the existing 201-byte diagnostic TX buffer. That pinned
BA2 link reported `bss=30421`,
`_minimum_heap_end=0x0400679c`, stack 6000, and a post-change linker margin of
**244 bytes**:
`32692 - ((0x0400679c - 0x0400004c) + 6000)`.

Historical pinned BA2 result for the unqualified, pre-TX-persistence OCB
metadata-export candidate:

```
text=255136  data=2104  bss=30421
bin sha256 cf1cb12d49a7721779b1f46ec18ff75cc09f9b9b9503d6509edf19fa7d5dbee4
elf sha256 fb2aa7369847e04ac03881e81b9d8ac76b108a1fae905a5b5ed51d72a4b6d6e9
DIAG_FW_BUILD_ID=0x0101c525  capability bitmap=0x000000000000c60f
```

Two builds, including a clean regeneration/relink, produced that same BIN
hash. This records reproducibility of the historical source only; no image was
flashed and no OCB UART exchange, reset behavior, counter correctness, or
current TX-persistence integration was hardware-qualified.

### Default-off experimental trusted-serial key export

`OCB_KEY_EXPORT_RESTORE_EXPERIMENTAL=1` adds a 30-second public nonce
confirmation and typed export of the active network key/counter, default TC
link key/counters, the one generated live APS key-table slot, and up to 70
flash TCLK credentials by index. It does not claim authentication or
confidentiality. Flash-TCLK counters cannot be read or restored through a
supported v2395 API, so restore commands return a precise unsupported status,
do not create PDM staging data, do not mutate active state, and do not reboot.
Experimental capability bit 16 is advertised; reserved production
BackupCapable bit 17 remains clear.

Historical pre-TX-persistence experimental pinned-BA2 build:

```
text=258156  data=2104  bss=30533
bin sha256 9afb98242e2573f3c14808736db457c0bae74039b104690701393aca1593422b
_minimum_heap_end=0x0400680c  stack=6000  linker RAM margin=132 bytes
```

Other valid feature cells were also clean-built:

```
typed=0 experimental=0 raw_pdm=0:
  text=252992 data=2104 bss=30349
  bin=103f2f6384a4a7f89e748f4f9bff91aafab22f68226dc0d2458dfc6e90669bd1

typed=0 experimental=0 raw_pdm=1 (explicit insecure development only):

  bin=1879fcaf4ba89295a382bbbc522f6fb6510f16a4c3b46d95ad6713ac91c2f5b0
```

The current default production cell is no longer expected to be byte-identical
to that prior metadata image because TX persistence adds code and three bytes
of cache BSS. Invalid combinations (experimental without typed OCB, or any
production/experimental OCB with raw PDM) are rejected by the Makefile and
`scripts/check.sh`.

## Historical pre-OCB baseline — reproducible linking image achieved

The historical pre-OCB requested image **compiled and linked**:
`ZigbeeNodeControlBridge_JN5169_GP_Proxy_COORDINATOR_115200.{elf,bin}`
(JN5169 / COORDINATOR / 115200 / GP_SUPPORT=1 / LEGACY=1 / R23_UPDATES=0 /
WWAH=0). Two clean builds are **byte-identical** (`.bin` and `.elf`):

```
bin sha256 54eda516db00d7101ce3508bfb218e8e0755e9b14882fa3cff0c16228157cb28
elf sha256 da0180668b0fbd3ba051fe6a207bc1eb7f506f01ed13df315427f0575b76ed75
text=253604  data=2104  bss=30349          (ba-elf-size totals)
.text=249744  .rodata=3860  .data=2028  .bss=22348  .heap=2000  .stack=6000
```

Note on the `.elf` hash: the loadable image (`.bin`, and therefore every
allocatable section) has been unchanged at
`54eda516db00d7101ce3508bfb218e8e0755e9b14882fa3cff0c16228157cb28` since the
rev9 F1…F5 fixes. The `.elf` hash moved when the APDU-diagnostics prototypes
were wired up (`zigate_apdu_diag.h`) purely because adding `#include` lines
shifts line numbers in `.debug_line` and adds a file name to `.debug_str`.
Adding a prototype for a `uint8 (void)` function changes no codegen on this
ABI: `.text`, `.rodata`, `.data` and `.bss` are byte-for-byte identical, as
proven by the unchanged `.bin`.

Link-time RAM margin, computed with the linker's own expression
(`Chip/JN5168/Build/AppBuildEnd.ld:106`,
`ASSERT(LENGTH(ram) > ((_minimum_heap_end - ABSOLUTE(ORIGIN(ram))) + __stack_size))`):

```
LENGTH(ram)        = 0x07fb4    (32692)
ORIGIN(ram)        = 0x0400004c
_minimum_heap_end  = 0x04006754
__stack_size       = 0x01770    (6000)

used   = (0x04006754 - 0x0400004c) + 0x1770 = 0x6708 + 0x1770 = 0x7e78 (32376)
margin = 0x7fb4 - 0x7e78                    = 0x13c            = 316 bytes
```

Note on the historical figure: earlier revisions of this document quoted
**240 B**, obtained by subtracting `0x04000000` instead of `ORIGIN(ram)` from
`_minimum_heap_end` (i.e. `0x7fb4 - (0x6754 + 0x1770)`). That drops the
`0x4c` RAM origin offset and is therefore **76 B conservative**, not the
linker's number. The linker's margin has been **316 B** for every revision from
rev3 onwards, because `.data`/`.bss`/`_minimum_heap_end`/`__stack_size` have not
moved across rev3…rev9. The conservative 240 B figure is retained nowhere; all
RAM statements in this document now use the linker expression above.

(Hashes above are for **proto 1.2 / build rev 9**, which restores the
endpoint-1 raw-NCP transmit allowlist after physical HIL, on top of the rev8
correlated Green Power commissioning command `0x0D17`/`0x8D17`. Both BIN and
ELF were reproduced byte-for-byte by two clean local builds. rev9 is
descriptor-only on the ZPS side: eight `const uint16` cluster ids were added to
`s_au16Endpoint1OutputClusterList`, costing **16 B of `.text`** and **zero**
`.data`/`.bss`.
rev9 also carries the post-review fix that makes the endpoint-1 Time server
read-only over Zigbee (see "Time cluster ownership" below): one 58-byte
`.text` function (`bZigate_VetoRemoteTimeWrite`) plus its call site, **+60 B of
flash and zero `.data`/`.bss`**, so the link-time RAM margin is unchanged at
316 B. Neither the host wire ABI, `DIAG_PROTO_MINOR`, `DIAG_BUILD_REVISION`
nor `DIAG_FW_BUILD_ID` (`0x01014525`) changed, so the fix was folded into that
historical non-OCB rev9 build rather than widening it at that stage. Its
superseded artifact `bin 457c49fc… / elf 417f09f2…` at `text=253544` existed
only in the working tree and appears nowhere in committed history.
The rev8 image was `bin 2bc2b354… / elf 17ba7210…` at `text=253528`; rev8 adds
a 32-bit per-request transaction id to that one command
(request 3 → 7 bytes, response 5 → 9 bytes) and costs 56 B of `.text` and
**zero** `.bss`/`.data`.
rev8 was never flashed or published, so its ABI was corrected in place before
release rather than being widened to a rev9: the byte-wide transaction id of
the first rev8 draft (request 4 / response 6 bytes) could wrap among callers
queued on the host's serialized request lock, and the same pass fixed a
one-byte stack overflow in the diagnostic `0x8000` status helper
(`au8Status[8]` → `[9]`, because `vSL_WriteMessage()` writes the link-quality
byte at `pu8Data[8]`).
The rev7 image, whose 0x8D17 response carried no correlation field, was
`bin c612e896… / elf b1457e86…` at `text=253464`.
The rev6 image, which advertised the GP capability bit without a command
behind it, was `bin 3f601b06… / elf d54e19b7…` at `text=253092`.
The rev4 image before the additive GP capability bit was
`bin e4f00796… / elf d903dc16…`.
The earlier rev3 image was `bin 7a878ca6… / elf 872b6d5d….`)

### Independent-review fixes (applied before final build)

1. **`case E_SL_MSG_SET_EXT_PANID` restored** in `app_Znc_cmds.c`. The manuf-code
   case insertion had dropped the label, orphaning the ExtPANID handler
   (`ZPS_eAplAibSetApsUseExtendedPanId`) as unreachable dead code so
   `0x0020` silently fell through to default. The label is restored; the block
   is reachable again.
2. **Manufacturer RESTORE_DEFAULT / default field** now uses the **actual
   shipped Node-Descriptor default 0x1147** (`.zpscfg`
   `ManufacturerCode="4423"`), captured by snapshotting the live descriptor
   **once before any SET** (single source of truth), not the wrong
   `ZCL_MANUFACTURER_CODE` (0x1037). `DIAG_MANUF_CODE_SHIPPED_DEFAULT` (0x1147)
   is the documented fallback. Docs updated.
3. **Neighbour IEEE bound** now uses `psNib->sTblSize.u16MacAddTableSize` (the
   MAC address-table size that `u16Lookup` / `ZPS_u64NwkNibGetMappedIeeeAddr`
   index) instead of the smaller, unrelated `u16AddrMap` (nwkAddressMap size),
   so valid mapped IEEE addresses at lookup indices ≥ `u16AddrMap` are no longer
   wrongly reported as NA. Verified against the SDK's own use in
   `appZpsExtendedDebug.c`.

Determinism is pinned by `scripts/build.sh` (`LC_ALL=C`, `TZ=UTC`,
`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`). Both Blocker A and Blocker B are resolved; the validated
safety fixes, the custom diagnostic ABI and the negotiated manufacturer-code
command are implemented (see below).

### Implicit function declarations are forbidden in the diagnostics paths

OpenLumi called the APDU-pool helpers `u8GetApduUse()` / `u8GetMaxApdu()`
without any prototype in scope. Under C89 rules GCC then invents
`int u8GetApduUse()`, which assumes the wrong return type and disables
argument checking. It happened to be harmless here — both functions really
return `uint8`, every call site immediately truncates the result to one octet
via `ZNC_BUF_U8_UPD`, and the `.bin` is unchanged now that the prototypes are
visible — but it is exactly the class of defect that turns into a silent
wrong-value or stack-corruption bug the moment a signature changes.

Fix, in three parts:

1. **One declaration, in a dependency-free header.**
   `zcl_overlay/zigate_apdu_diag.h` declares both symbols and includes
   `<jendefs.h>` and nothing else, so it cannot participate in an include
   cycle. `zigate_compat.h` now *includes* it instead of restating the
   prototypes, so there is exactly one declaration of each symbol in the tree
   and the definitions in `zigate_compat.c` are checked against it.
   The diagnostics translation units (`custom_diag.c`,
   `app_general_events_handler.c`) include the small header directly rather
   than `zigate_compat.h`, which would have dragged `zcl_options.h`, `zcl.h`,
   `ZclTime.h`, `WindowCovering.h`, `control_bridge.h` and
   `MultistateInputBasic.h` into the host-diagnostics path for the sake of two
   `uint8 (void)` prototypes.
2. **Hard build failure on recurrence.** `DIAG_STRICT_OBJS` in
   `app/Build/ZigbeeNodeControlBridge/Makefile` adds
   `-Werror=implicit-function-declaration` to `custom_diag.o`,
   `app_general_events_handler.o`, `app_zcl_event_handler.o`,
   `app_Znc_cmds.o` and `zigate_compat.o`. It is scoped per object (the same
   pattern as `WindowCovering.o: CFLAGS += -DCLD_WINDOW_COVERING`) because the
   stock SDK sources in this tree are *not* clean under this flag — e.g.
   `Components/ZCL/Clusters/OTA/Source/OTA_common.c:261` calls
   `OTA_SetNewImageFlag` implicitly. That is stock v2395 code, out of scope,
   and left untouched.
3. **Machine-checked.** `scripts/check.sh` asserts that the header declares
   both symbols, that it includes only `jendefs.h`, that each symbol is
   declared in exactly one file, and that *every* `.c` calling them both
   includes a declaring header and appears in `DIAG_STRICT_OBJS`. The caller
   set is discovered by grep, so a new call site in a new file fails the check
   until it is wired up.

After the fix the application sources emit **zero**
`-Wimplicit-function-declaration` diagnostics.

### RAM budget note (JN5169 32 KB SRAM)

The stock GP-proxy coordinator `.zpscfg` shipped `RoutingTableSize="255"`
(a 3060-byte route table) which overflowed SRAM by 1428 B at link
(`ASSERT ... "Possible overflow of RAM"`). It was right-sized to `70` to match
the four sibling coordinator `.zpscfg` variants in this tree, recovering
2208 B of BSS. Current margin against the link-time RAM assert is small
(**316 B**, derived above with the linker's own `ORIGIN(ram)`-relative
expression); new features that add BSS must be checked against that assert.

### Green Power RAM reduction — evaluated, capacities preserved

The correction asked to reduce GP RAM per OpenLumi master `a0beb6f` "Reduce
Green Power coordinator RAM usage" **if safely possible, without silently
lowering documented capacities**. Findings:

- This target builds as `GP_PROXY_BASIC_DEVICE` (not `GP_COMBO_BASIC_DEVICE`),
  so the 1320-byte translation table (`asGpTranslationTable[5]`, guarded by
  `#ifdef GP_COMBO_BASIC_DEVICE`) is **already excluded** from this image.
- The remaining GP RAM is the combined proxy/sink table
  `sGPDeviceInfo…asZgpsSinkProxyTable[GP_NUMBER_OF_PROXY_SINK_TABLE_ENTRIES=5]`
  and the generated GP security table / TX queue (`.zpscfg`
  `GreenPowerSecurityTable Size="5"`, `GreenPowerTxQueue Size="5"`). A closer
  audit confirms **every** GP sizing macro is at its SDK default and is **not**
  overridden anywhere in this tree: proxy/sink=5, duplicate-filter=5,
  buffered-records=4, paired-endpoints=5, sink-group-list=2. None are inflated,
  so there is no oversized allocation to trim. These are the documented
  operational capacities (5 proxied GPDs / 5 security entries / 5 queued
  frames); reducing them lowers documented capacity, which the correction
  forbids.
- The `a0beb6f` diff cannot be fetched (no network access) to reproduce a
  capacity-neutral reduction verbatim, and inventing table shrinks would breach
  the "do not silently lower documented capacities" constraint.
- **Net:** GP capacities are left intact. RAM/flash was instead reclaimed by
  removing the security-sensitive TCLK 0x0D00 subsystem (−68 B `.data`,
  −804 B text). This item is documented as deliberately deferred rather than
  applied blind.

## What works today (baseline established)

1. **Repository structure** — v2395 SDK at the repo root with upstream history
   preserved and the application isolated under `app/`.
2. **Toolchain integration** — BA2 `ba-elf-gcc 4.7.4` compiles and assembles
   (verified on `irq_JN516x.S`, `portasm_JN516x.S`, `port_JN516x.c`).
3. **Config regeneration with v2395 tools** — `PDUMConfig` and `ZPSConfig`
   (the v2395 shell+python3 generators) run and regenerate `pdum_gen.*` and
   `zps_gen.*` from the coordinator GP-proxy `.zpscfg`, resolving library
   context sizes against `libZPSAPL_LEGACY_JN516x.a`. Two host-portability
   fixes were required (committed, see below).
4. **Library selection** — `LEGACY=1` correctly selects
   `libZPSAPL_LEGACY_JN516x.a` + `-DLEGACY_SUPPORT`; `R23_UPDATES=0`/`WWAH=0`
   correctly omit `-DR23_UPDATES`/`-DWWAH_SUPPORT`; `GP_SUPPORT=1` pulls in
   `app_green_power.c`, the GP-proxy `.zpscfg`, and `-DCLD_GREENPOWER`.

The build proceeds through application C compilation and **links** the final
image; the 1840→2395 API deltas that surface there are resolved (Blocker A/B).

## Host-portability fixes applied to the v2395 SDK generators (committed)

Both are in `Tools/{ZPSConfig,PDUMConfig}/Source/*`:

1. **CRLF → LF** on the two generator scripts. They shipped with CRLF, so the
   `#!/bin/sh\r` shebang failed on macOS ("command not found" /
   "No such file or directory").
2. **`ZPSConfig` objdump path** — for `BIG_ENDIAN` (the JN516x/BA2 default) the
   tool hardcoded Windows separators (`ToolsDir\\bin\\ba-elf-objdump`),
   producing an invalid path on POSIX and a silent
   *"Unable to locate '.zps_apl_ZdoDefaultServerContextSize' section"*. Made
   `os.name`-aware, mirroring the existing `arm-none-eabi` else-branch.

## Blocker A — application uses SDK symbols that changed 1840→2395  [RESOLVED]

Resolved via a thin app-level overlay `app/Source/ZigbeeNodeControlBridge/
zcl_overlay/zigate_compat.{h,c}` (no OpenLumi ZCL forward-ported). Address-mode
extensions are additive constants over the SDK enum (BROADCAST=0x04, *_NO_ACK
0x06/0x07/0x08, per zigpy-zigate); WindowCovering renames map to
`E_CLD_WC_CMD_*` with axis-split payload wrappers onto the v2395 Lift/Tilt send
functions; APDU diagnostics wrap stock `PDUM_u16APduGetCrtUse/MaxUse`. A genuine
latent v2395 SDK typo in `WindowCoveringCommands.c` (GoToTiltValueSend defined
with the Lift payload type) was fixed to match its header. Original delta table
retained below for provenance.

First failing translation unit: `app/Source/ZigbeeNodeControlBridge/app_Znc_cmds.c`.
Representative errors (v2395):

| Symbol used by app (1840)                              | v2395 status | Notes / candidate |
|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| `tsZLO_ControlBridgeDevice.sTimeServerCluster`         | removed      | Time server not in stock v2395 ControlBridge device (see Blocker B). |
| `E_CLD_WINDOWCOVERING_CMD_UP_OPEN` / `_DOWN_CLOSE` / `_STOP` | removed | v2395 `WindowCovering.h` differs; command enum renamed/removed. |
| `E_CLD_WINDOWCOVERING_CMD_GO_TO_LIFT_VALUE` / `_TILT_VALUE` | removed | Payloads are now `tsCLD_WindowCovering_GoToLiftValuePayload` / `...TiltValuePayload` (not `..._GoToValueRequestPayload`). |
| `E_CLD_WINDOWCOVERING_CMD_GO_TO_LIFT_PERCENTAGE` / `_TILT_PERCENTAGE` | removed | Payloads now `tsCLD_WindowCovering_GoToLiftPercentagePayload` / `...TiltPercentagePayload`. |
| `tsCLD_WindowCovering_GoToValueRequestPayload`         | removed      | Split into Lift/Tilt payload structs. |
| `tsCLD_WindowCovering_GoToPercentageRequestPayload`    | removed      | Split into Lift/Tilt payload structs. |
| `ZPS_E_ADDR_MODE_BROADCAST`                            | removed      | v2395 `zps_apl_af.h` keeps only `BOUND/GROUP/IEEE/SHORT`. ZCL-layer analogues exist: `E_ZCL_AM_BROADCAST`. |
| `ZPS_E_ADDR_MODE_BOUND_NO_ACK`                         | removed      | ZCL analogue `E_ZCL_AM_BOUND_NO_ACK`. |
| `ZPS_E_ADDR_MODE_SHORT_NO_ACK`                         | removed      | No direct v2395 analogue; needs semantic mapping. |
| `ZPS_E_ADDR_MODE_IEEE_NO_ACK`                          | removed      | ZCL analogue `E_ZCL_AM_IEEE_NO_ACK`. |

These are **not blind renames**: the address-mode and window-covering command
mappings change wire/dispatch semantics and must be validated (the coordinator
serialises these to the host protocol). Expect further deltas in the larger
units after `app_Znc_cmds.c` is resolved (`app_zcl_event_handler.c`,
`app_start.c`, `app_general_events_handler.c`, `app_green_power.c`).

## Blocker B — OpenLumi modified the SDK ZCL device/cluster layer  [RESOLVED]

Resolved by adapting the app to stock v2395 rather than forward-porting the
OpenLumi ZCL. A minimal endpoint-1 overlay now registers a real **Time
server**, **Window Covering client**, and **IAS Warning Device client**. The
Time factory uses the existing `sZigateTimeServerCluster`, so network reads,
host SET/GET, and the existing 1 Hz increment all share the same UTC storage.
The two client instances make the existing Window Covering and IAS WD serial
send paths pass v2395's local-cluster lookup instead of returning
`E_ZCL_ERR_CLUSTER_NOT_FOUND`.

The overlay appends three instances to the stock ControlBridge instance array;
the stock registration routine remains unchanged and includes them through
its existing `sizeof` count. Compile-time offset checks enforce that the three
instances stay contiguous at the array tail. Enabling the v2395 Window
Covering client exposed two stock implementation defects (a missing client
attribute-definition comma and client initialization cast to the server
type); both were corrected to match `WindowCovering.h`.

Private OpenLumi quirks that depend on the modified SDK ZCL — OnOff 0xFD
"Lora tap", IKEA remote Scenes commands — are gated behind
`ZIGATE_ENABLE_OPENLUMI_PRIVATE_QUIRKS` (default OFF); the private Legrand
Basic attribute is disabled. The real stock cluster
`GENERAL_CLUSTER_ID_MULTISTATE_INPUT_BASIC` is resolved by including
`MultistateInputBasic.h`. Historical analysis retained below.

### Endpoint-1 descriptor/runtime reconciliation

The selected GP Proxy coordinator `.zpscfg` advertises the runtime server set
**Basic, Groups, On/Off, OTA, Time**, and the endpoint-1 **OutputClusters**
list documented under "raw-NCP transmit allowlist" below. Groups and On/Off
server descriptors were made discoverable. The `0xFFFF` Default input remains
non-discoverable because ZiGate raw/hybrid APS forwarding uses it as the
generic endpoint-1 sink.

False *input* (server) descriptor entries were removed in rev6 rather than
spending the remaining RAM on unsupported instances, and that pruning stands:

- input-side client-only entries (Colour, Identify, Level, Scenes, Door Lock,
  Metering, IAS Zone, Thermostat, measurement clients, Diagnostics and ZLL
  Commissioning) were removed from the server list;
- unsupported input servers (Power Configuration, Thermostat UI, Appliance
  Statistics, Electrical Measurement, Illuminance Level, Occupancy and
  Pressure) were removed.

### Endpoint-1 output descriptor (rev9, corrected after HIL)

rev6 also pruned the **output** list on the same "no local client instance =
false advertisement" reasoning. Physical HIL after the host-side `0x0530`
fixes shows that reasoning does not hold for an NCP:

- a raw Basic `0x0000` read succeeds — and it succeeds *only* because Basic
  survived the pruning as an output cluster;
- a raw Power Configuration `0x0001` read or configure-reporting is rejected
  **locally by the JN5169** with APS status `0xA3`
  (`ZPS_APL_APS_E_ILLEGAL_REQUEST`) before anything is transmitted, because
  endpoint 1 no longer lists `0x0001` as an output cluster.

rev9 restored the entries the hub legitimately originates. Later rev17
disassembly established that the original HIL split was correlation rather
than proof of the proposed mechanism: `ZPS_eAplAfUnicastAckDataReq()` validates
the source endpoint and takes its profile ID, but does not search the endpoint
output-cluster list. The list remains the truthful advertised descriptor for
the host+NCP pair, not a firmware-resident ZCL-instance list:

| Cluster | Id | Why the hub originates it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Power Configuration | `0x0001` | battery reads and default battery-percentage reporting configuration |
| Multistate Input | `0x0012` | converter/interview attribute reads |
| OTA Upgrade | `0x0019` | host-driven OTA server frames (Image Notify, block/query responses) are sent through raw `0x0530` |
| Thermostat UI Configuration | `0x0204` | display-mode / keypad-lockout reads and writes |
| Illuminance Level Sensing | `0x0401` | level-status / target-level reads |
| Pressure Measurement | `0x0403` | measured-value reads and reporting setup |
| Occupancy Sensing | `0x0406` | occupancy reads and reporting setup |
| Electrical Measurement | `0x0B04` | power/voltage/current reads and reporting setup |

Kept from before: Basic, Identify, Groups, Scenes, On/Off, Level Control,
Colour Control, Door Lock, Metering, IAS Zone, Thermostat, Illuminance
Measurement, Relative Humidity, Temperature, Diagnostics, Window Covering,
IAS Warning Device.

rev17 HIL reconfirmed that the exact publication-candidate BIN contains this
25-entry list, including `0x0001`, yet a Power Configuration raw request still
returned APS `0xA3`. The one-byte APS status is not the separate
`ZPS_teExtendedStatus` callback and therefore does not identify a rejected
field. The host now reports `0xA3` as a local rejection, logs stock-firmware
`0x9999` extended status when emitted, and decodes the request-sent, APS
sequence, NPDU-use and APDU-use bytes already appended to `0x8000`.

**Appliance Statistics `0x0B03` was deliberately NOT restored**: the host has
no decoder, converter, interview or command path for it — only a cluster-name
string — so no legitimate origination exists to authorize.

Two invariants this must not violate, both asserted by `scripts/check.sh`:

1. **No ZCL runtime instances are added for raw APS.** An output-descriptor
   entry advertises the host+NCP surface but is not consulted by the linked
   raw-unicast implementation. It must not be paired with a local cluster
   instance merely to send `0x0530`. Local
   instances remain necessary only where the *firmware itself* calls
   `eZCL_CustomCommandSend` (Window Covering client, IAS WD client) or answers
   network reads (Time server) — exactly the three overlay instances.
2. **Flash/const only.** The additions land in
   `s_au16Endpoint1OutputClusterList` (`const uint16`, .rodata): `text`
   253528 → 253544 (+16 B = 8 × 2 B), `data` 2104 and `bss` 30349 unchanged,
   link-time RAM margin still 316 B. (The final rev9 image is `text` 253604
   because of the +60 B Time-write veto described above; that is also
   `.text`-only and leaves `data`/`bss`/margin unchanged.)

Endpoint 242 Green Power descriptors and all ZDP endpoint-0 descriptors are
unchanged. The raw APS serial command itself is unchanged.

### Time cluster ownership — host-owned, read-only over Zigbee

`sZigateTimeServerCluster` (`zcl_overlay/zigate_compat.c`) is the single UTC
value shared by the host protocol and the endpoint-1 ZCL Time server
(cluster `0x000A`). Its access model is:

| Path | Direction | Allowed |
|---|---|---|
| `E_SL_MSG_SET_TIMESERVER` (`0x0016`, UART host) | write | **yes** |
| 1 Hz increment in `app_start.c` | write | **yes** |
| `E_SL_MSG_GET_TIMESERVER` (`0x0017`, UART host) | read | **yes** |
| Remote ZCL Read Attributes, EP1 / `0x000A` | read | **yes** |
| Remote ZCL Write Attributes, EP1 / `0x000A` | write | **no** — ZCL status `0x7e` NOT_AUTHORIZED |

Why the veto is required. `ZclTime.h` marks `Time` and `TimeStatus`
`(E_ZCL_AF_RD | E_ZCL_AF_WR)` when `TIME_SERVER` is defined, and although
`sCLD_Time` declares `E_ZCL_SECURITY_APPLINK`, `zcl.c:128` initialises
`psZCL_Common->eSecuritySupported` to `E_ZCL_SECURITY_NETWORK` and this
application never calls `eZCL_SetSupportedSecurity()`, so `zcl_event.c:653-654`
clamps the cluster's requirement back down to NETWORK. Registering the Time
server for network *reads* therefore also opened a network *write* path: any
node holding only the network key could rewrite the clock the host reads back
over `0x0017`. Before rev9 registered the server this storage had no network
path at all, so this was a newly introduced surface, not an inherited one.

How the veto works. `bZigate_VetoRemoteTimeWrite()` handles
`E_ZCL_CBET_CHECK_ATTRIBUTE_RANGE` and sets
`uMessage.sIndividualAttributeResponse.eAttributeStatus =
E_ZCL_ERR_ATTRIBUTES_ACCESS` for any Time **server** instance.
`zcl_WriteAttributesRequestHandle.c:290-294` maps that to
`E_ZCL_CMDS_NOT_AUTHORIZED` (`0x7e`), and the mutation at `:324-337` is gated
on `u8errorCode == E_ZCL_CMDS_SUCCESS`, so **the attribute is never written**.
For the *undivided* write variant the range check runs on pass 0 and clears
`bNoErrors` (declared once at `:133`, never reset), which gates the pass-1
write through `(bNoErrors || !bIsUndivided)` — the whole undivided record set
is refused.

Why it cannot be bypassed, and cannot misfire:

- `E_ZCL_CBET_CHECK_ATTRIBUTE_RANGE` has exactly **one** emitter in the SDK,
  the remote Write Attributes handler. Host `SET` and the 1 Hz increment write
  the struct directly and never traverse ZCL, so they are structurally
  unreachable from the veto.
- The call is the **first statement** of `APP_ZCL_cbEndpointCallback`, above the
  `RAW_MODE_ON` block that forwards the indication to the host and returns
  early. Placing it after that block would let raw mode skip authorization
  entirely.
- Both properties are machine-checked by `scripts/check.sh`: it asserts the
  single-emitter property, the `E_ZCL_ERR_ATTRIBUTES_ACCESS → NOT_AUTHORIZED`
  mapping, that the host SET/increment still write the struct directly, and —
  by line-number ordering inside the function body — that the veto call
  precedes the `RAW_MODE_ON` block with no `return` before it. The call must
  appear as a real `(void)…;` statement, so a comment mentioning the function
  does not satisfy the assertion.
- Three compile-time asserts in `zigate_compat.c` pin
  `E_ZCL_CMDS_SUCCESS == 0`, `E_ZCL_ERR_ATTRIBUTES_ACCESS != E_ZCL_CMDS_SUCCESS`
  and `E_ZCL_CMDS_NOT_AUTHORIZED == 0x7e`, so an SDK renumbering breaks the
  build instead of silently degrading the veto into a soft `INVALID_VALUE`.

Cost: 58 B of `.text` for the function plus its call site (+60 B of flash
total), zero `.data`/`.bss`, no change to the host wire ABI.

### OTA build-variable reality

The target still passes `OTA=0`, but the Makefile does not consume that
variable to disable OTA. `zcl_options.h` unconditionally defines
`CLD_OTA`/`OTA_SERVER`, OTA sources are linked, and endpoint 1 truthfully
advertises the OTA server. Thus `OTA=0` currently **does not disable OTA**.

Stock v2395 `Components/ZCL/Devices/ZLO/Include/control_bridge.h` does **not**
contain the clusters the OpenLumi app expects. The OpenLumi 1840 device added,
among others: **Time server**, **WindowCovering client**, **Thermostat
server/UI-config client**, **IAS Zone server**, **Electrical Measurement**,
**Multistate in/out**, **Binary Input**, **PowerConfiguration client**,
**AnalogInput client**, **PressureMeasurement client**, and private
**Philips**/**Terncy** clusters.

Scope of the ZCL divergence between the OpenLumi-1840 tree and stock-2395:
**337 files differ substantively** (beyond CRLF) across `Components/ZCL`. This
mixes OpenLumi's additions with NXP's own 1840→2395 evolution, and cannot be
cleanly three-way separated without a pristine NXP-1840 ZCL tree.

### Recommended strategy (matches the "clean subtree + patch series" design)

Adapt the **application** to the **stock v2395** ZCL/device layer rather than
dragging the OpenLumi-1840 ZCL forward (which would also risk ABI mismatch with
the v2395 prebuilt `libZPSAPL`/`libZCL` binaries). Concretely:

1. Add the ZiGate-specific clusters the app needs as a **thin, self-contained
   overlay** compiled into the app (e.g. an `app/Source/ZigbeeNodeControlBridge/
   zcl_overlay/` providing Time server, WindowCovering client, private
   Xiaomi/Philips/Terncy clusters, IKEA scenes), instead of editing the SDK.
2. Re-express the app's ControlBridge device registration against stock v2395
   `control_bridge.{c,h}` plus the overlay clusters.
3. Resolve Blocker A symbol deltas with validated mappings.
4. Add protocol extensions and safety fixes as reviewable commits.

## Diagnostic ABI — proto 1.2 / build rev 18

- Protocol **1.2**, build **rev 18**; capability response `0x8D0F`;
  wrapper-default deterministic build id `0x010DC53E` and capability bitmap
  `0x00000000000CC60F`. The earlier rev9 build without typed OCB capability
  bit 15 used build ID `0x01014525` (rev8 was `0x01014524`, rev7
  `0x0101452B`). Enabling experimental bit 16 produces `0x010CC53E`.
- **Boot reset snapshot (rev12)** — capability bit 18 gates the additive empty
  `0x0D2B` request and six-byte `0x8D2B` response. It snapshots
  `u16AHI_PowerStatus()`, watchdog-reset, and brownout-reset at entry to
  `vAppMain()`. Rev14 implements the existing reason byte with a guarded
  `NOLOAD` SRAM marker for synchronous exceptions and requested software
  resets; no PDM write occurs. Exact framing is in
  `RESET_DIAGNOSTIC_ABI.md`.
- **Exception context (rev15 instrumentation, rev16 negotiation fix)** —
  independent capability bit 19 gates empty request
  `0x0D2C` and exact 22-byte response `0x8D2C`. Bus errors retain EPCR, EEAR,
  handler SP and interrupted LR/r9. The obsolete exception stack walk was
  removed because it dereferenced memory after a bus error and could obscure
  the original fault. Bit 18 continues to guarantee only the shipped
  `0x0D2B` reset-summary contract.
- **APS key-index guard (rev17)** — the linker wraps the v2395
  `zps_psFindKeyDescr()` lookup and defines its output index only on a `NULL`
  return. This prevents `bDuplicateCheck()` from indexing its incoming frame
  counter array with a stale CRC value without changing key matching or replay
  comparison.
- **TX-power PDM ID simplification (rev18)** — the current packed five-byte v2
  record uses application PDM ID `0x0011` directly. The incompatible
  rev9/rev10 test record was never distributed in a product variant, so no
  replacement ID or migration is retained; affected test devices may be
  factory-reset. Record validation, save readback, restore ordering and UART
  behavior are unchanged.
- **The rev8→rev9 revision change itself was descriptor-only.** No existing
  command encoding changed: the revision identified restoration of endpoint
  1's raw-`0x0530` output-cluster allowlist. The current unpublished candidate
  also adds capability-gated OCB opcodes and TX persistence. Typed OCB changes
  the deterministic build ID through capability bit 15; TX persistence changes
  behavior but not command layout, diagnostic protocol version, or capability
  bits.
- **Green Power commissioning** is capability bit `1 << 3`. Since rev7 it is
  backed by a real negotiated command, `0x0D17`/`0x8D17`, and the bit and the
  handler share one compile switch (`DIAG_HAVE_GP_COMMISSIONING`, derived from
  `CLD_GREENPOWER`) so no build can advertise the capability without
  implementing it. The firmware drives its **own** Green Power proxy
  commissioning state machine on the locally mapped GP endpoint
  (`GREENPOWER_END_POINT_ID = 2`) towards APS endpoint 242, and the SDK's 20 ms
  GP scheduler closes the window when the requested 1..255 s timeout expires.
  This replaces the rev5/rev6 arrangement where the bit was advertised with no
  command behind it and the host emulated the operation with a raw `0x0530`
  send-data frame aimed at `0xFFFC` — an acknowledged unicast encoding that the
  physical rev6 HIL rejected with `ZPS_APL_APS_E_NO_ACK` (`0xA6`), and which
  would not have opened the coordinator's local window even if it had been
  transmitted. See [`DIAGNOSTIC_ABI_GREEN_POWER.md`](DIAGNOSTIC_ABI_GREEN_POWER.md).
  GP shared-key programming remains deliberately unimplemented and
  unadvertised because no corresponding serial command exists.
- **Per-request correlation (rev8)** — the rev7 `0x0D17`/`0x8D17` pair carried
  no correlation field, and the stock serial protocol correlates a data
  response only by its response type. A valid but late `0x8D17` answering a
  request the host had already timed out was therefore indistinguishable from
  the answer to the *next* request and could be consumed by it, reporting a
  stale commissioning window as the current one. rev8 re-encodes only this
  command: the request is `version, transaction_id[4, big-endian], action,
  timeout_seconds` (7 bytes) and the response is
  `version, transaction_id[4, big-endian], status, effective_mode,
  effective_timeout, gp_status` (9 bytes). The id is 32 bits wide, encoded
  big-endian like the `0x0D0F` nonce, so a host counter cannot wrap onto the
  id of a still-outstanding transaction while callers queue on the host's
  serialized request lock; the first rev8 draft used a single byte and could.
  The firmware treats the id as opaque and echoes it on every response emitted
  for a structurally valid request, success or Green Power failure. It also
  emits `status = OK` if and only if the underlying GP call returned
  `E_ZCL_SUCCESS`, an invariant the host now enforces on receive. The protocol
  version stays 1.2 and every other command encoding is byte-identical; the
  command is capability-gated and hosts re-negotiate `0x0D0F` (and read the
  changed build id) before using it.
- **Diagnostic `0x8000` status buffer (rev8 release gate)** — `vDiagSendStatus()`
  in `custom_diag.c` serialises 8 payload bytes and `vSL_WriteMessage()` then
  writes the link-quality byte at `pu8Data[8]`, but the local buffer was
  `uint8 au8Status[8]`, so every diagnostic status frame overflowed its own
  stack frame by exactly one byte. The buffer is now `[9]`; `scripts/check.sh`
  asserts it.
- **Canonical TX-power semantics (rev4)** — corrected from rev3 per the
  physical HIL + MiniMac disassembly: in the linked MiniMac path **0x40 is NOT
  round-trippable** (SET sign-extends the low 6 bits to 0; GET returns a
  sign-extended i8, e.g. code −8 reads back as `0xFFFFFFF8`). Therefore:
  - **SET** (`app_ahi_commands.c`) accepts only exact non-clamping codes
    `0x00..0x0A` (positive 0..10) and `0x20..0x3F` (6-bit two's-complement
    −32..−1); it **rejects** `0x0B..0x1F` and `0x40`+. A rejected SET emits the
    stock status frame only, no value frame.
  - **`0x8806`/`0x8807`** (`app_Znc_cmds.c`) return `byte0 = GET & 0x3F` (the
    canonical six-bit code) and `byte1 = legacy mapped level` derived from that
    six-bit code, then the appended LQI byte. (rev3 wrongly echoed the full
    raw low byte incl. the phantom 0x40 bit.)
  - **General diag** (`0x0D1F`) TX fields are `[six-bit code][six-bit code]
    [signed six-bit code]`, where signed = `(six & 0x20) ? six-64 : six`.
    Rev 6 makes both unsigned protocol-1.2 fields canonical; no phantom 0x40.
  - **The two representations deliberately DO NOT agree from rev6 onwards.**
    `0x8D1F` byte1 is the canonical raw six-bit register code; `0x8806`/`0x8807`
    byte1 is the **legacy mapped level** from the threshold ladder in
    `app_Znc_cmds.c:429-434` (`<=31 → 0`, `<=39 → 32`, `<=51 → 20`, else `9`).
    rev4 had kept them in agreement; rev6 diverged them on purpose and this is
    **not** a defect to be "harmonised": changing `0x8806`/`0x8807` would break
    deployed hosts that parse the legacy mapping, and changing `0x8D1F` would
    reintroduce a lossy mapping into the diagnostic path. Hosts must key the
    `0x8D1F` TX interpretation off **build revision ≥ 6** via
    `DIAG_FW_BUILD_ID`. No claim anywhere in this repository asserts that the
    two frames agree.
  - Wire shapes are byte-length-stable; only the byte *values*/validation
    changed, hence the proto-minor + build-rev bump (host validator must move
    to 1.2 / rev 4).
  - The coordinator now stores a successfully round-tripped `0x0806` value in
    the dedicated application record `PDM_ID_APP_TX_POWER` (`0x0011`). The
    current five-byte packed record carries `TX` magic, format version 2, the
    native code, and a CRC-8 check byte. The rev9 source called its structure
    five bytes, but BA2 ABI tail alignment made `sizeof` eight; the three
    padding bytes were not covered by the CRC. That rev9/rev10 record was
    experimental and never distributed in a product variant. Rev18 therefore
    uses `0x0011` directly for the current packed v2 record, with no reserved
    replacement ID or migration path. Test devices carrying the experimental
    record may be factory-reset.
    `ZPS_eAplAfInit()` is not the restore anchor: a later
    stack start can issue an MLME reset and restore PIB defaults. For a restored
    coordinator the order is `BDB_vStart()` →
    `BDB_vNfFormCentralizedNwk()` → `ZPS_eAplZdoStartStack()` →
    `ZPS_EVENT_NWK_STARTED`; for a factory-new coordinator the host formation
    command enters `BDB_eNfStartNwkFormation()` and reaches the same event.
    `bdb_taskBDB()` runs its init/formation state machines before forwarding
    that ZPS event through `BDB_EVENT_ZPSAF`. Published rev9 applied from
    `APP_vHandleStackEvents()` inside that callback chain; physical HIL on
    db6f8f2 showed that SET 7 reverted to default code 8 after adapter restart,
    so that ordering was not a valid persistence guarantee. Rev10 observes
    every forwarded `NWK_STARTED` in `APP_vBdbCallback` before endpoint routing,
    marks a RAM pending flag, lets `bdb_taskBDB()` drain its queue and return,
    and only then applies the cached value from `APP_vMainLoop()`.
    This is intentional: any later in-process
    `BDB_eNfStartNwkFormation()` accepted after BDB's on-network state has
    cleared invokes `BDB_vNfFormCentralizedNwk()` and
    `ZPS_eAplZdoStartStack()` again; its later `ZPS_EVENT_NWK_STARTED` may
    follow another default-PIB reset.
    Suppressing that event for the remainder of the boot would lose the
    persisted setting after re-formation. The validated record remains cached,
    so repeated network starts reapply the PIB but never reread or write PDM.
  - Wrong-size, wrong-magic, old-version, CRC-failing, and out-of-set records
    are invalid and cannot satisfy the equal-value write-elision test; the next
    successful SET replaces them. If an intact current record already stores
    the requested canonical code, the SET still performs and verifies the
    radio operation but skips `PDM_eSaveRecordData()`. A readable old PIB is
    required before any SET mutation. A SET is reported successful only after
    exact radio round-trip and either a matching valid record or a successful
    PDM save followed by an exact, fully validated PDM readback; every
    post-mutation failure rolls back to the readable old PIB.
    This changes neither `0x0806`/`0x0807` encoding nor accepted values. These
    are **native signed six-bit MiniMac codes**, not calibrated dBm
    measurements.
  - The build uses EEPROM PDM and calls `PDM_eInitialise(63)`. The new payload
    is only five bytes and does not enlarge existing network/security records,
    but PDM record metadata, segment allocation, wear state, and field-device
    occupancy are runtime concerns. No static source evidence proves that
    every deployed 63-segment store has room for another record. Save failure
    is fail-closed with PIB rollback; capacity and near-full/worn-store behavior
    remain hardware qualification items.
- **TCLK 0x0D00 diagnostic REMOVED** (security-sensitive). The feature exported
  the full internal TCLK/APS-security negotiation state over UART and
  interposed four ZPS crypto functions via `-Wl,--wrap`
  (`zps_eAplApsmeConfirmKeyReqRsp`, `zps_eAplSecEncryptPacket`,
  `zps_vGenerateHashForVerifiedKey`, `ZPS_u16NwkNibFindNwkAddr`). It exported no
  raw key/hash bytes and did no PDM restore, but instrumenting the crypto path
  and surfacing the internal security state machine is security-sensitive, so
  `tclk_diagnostic.{c,h}`, the four `--wrap` link flags, the 0x0D00 handler and
  all four instrumentation call sites were deleted. The `0x0D00` request ID is
  retained as reserved and now replies `0x8000` status "unhandled". The three
  general-diag TCLK bytes are retained in the 0x0D1F layout but are now always
  `NA` with `DIAG_GENDIAG_FLAG_TCLK_UNAVAILABLE` asserted.

## Validated safety fixes  [DONE]

- **Raw endpoint-0 ZDP bypass (rev12)** — in `RAW_MODE_ON`, endpoint-0
  responses/indications are forwarded from the original APDU and freed exactly
  once before returning, without calling `zps_bAplZdpUnpackResponse`.
  A structurally valid 12-byte Device_annce is the sole typed exception so the
  deployed `0x004D` join indication remains unchanged. Non-raw behavior is
  unchanged.
- **Immutable SerialLink TX (rev12)** — `vSL_WriteMessage()` no longer stores
  LQI at `pu8Data[u16Length]`. It computes checksum over a virtual trailing LQI
  and streams that byte through the existing escape function after the caller
  payload. XOR and CCITT golden checks preserve the historical wire bytes;
  exact-size and scalar callers no longer require writable tail storage.
- **Strict raw APS request bounds (rev12)** — `0x0530` validates address mode,
  the complete 12-byte short/18-byte IEEE header, and exact declared payload
  length before reading variable fields or calling the APDU allocation/copy
  helper. Malformed input returns `INCORRECT_PARAMETERS` with request-sent zero.
- **No hidden Xiaomi mutation** — removed the join-time global Node Descriptor
  `u16ManufacturerCode` rewrite in `app_general_events_handler.c`
  (`NWK_NEW_NODE_HAS_JOINED`); `DEVICE_ANNOUNCE` emission preserved.
- **256-byte ZCL serialization OOB** — the individual read/report attribute
  loop in `app_zcl_event_handler.c` now stops before the next worst-case
  (uint64) element would exceed the 256-byte stack tx buffer with the appended
  LQI byte reserved. Truncation is safe; the previous behaviour could corrupt
  the stack for long strings / large arrays.
- **Zero-init IKEA payloads** — the IKEA remote-scene path is compiled out
  (stock v2395 lacks the modified-SDK custom command; no payload is allocated
  in this baseline). The zero-init requirement is documented in-code at the
  gate for anyone enabling the quirk.
- **`APP_MigratePDM` disabled** — `app_start.c` keeps `//APP_MigratePDM();`
  (call site commented out). No raw migration runs.

## Negotiated manufacturer-code command  [DONE]

Implemented `0x0D16`/`0x8D16` (capability bit `1 << 10`, set only because the
handler exists) in `custom_diag.{c,h}` with dispatch in `app_Znc_cmds.c` and
the enum in `SerialLink.h`. Ops GET / SET / RESTORE_DEFAULT act on the single
**global** Node Descriptor via public `ZPS_psGetLocalNodeDescriptor()` with
mandatory readback (SET returns OK only when the re-read code equals the
request). RESTORE targets the **shipped Node-Descriptor default 0x1147**
(`.zpscfg` `ManufacturerCode="4423"`), captured by snapshotting the live
descriptor **once before any SET** (single source of truth), with the
compile-time `DIAG_MANUF_CODE_SHIPPED_DEFAULT` (0x1147) only as a fallback. This
is deliberately **not** `ZCL_MANUFACTURER_CODE` (0x1037), which is the ZCL
attribute default and would restore the wrong value. No PDM write. The
firmware makes no per-device scoping claim — the host serialises coordinator
use via its lease (`zigbee/manufcode_lease.go`). Matches
`docs/DIAGNOSTIC_ABI_MANUFACTURER_CODE.md` and the Go host ABI. Stock /
handler-less builds leave the bit clear, so the host sees `ErrUnsupported`
(backward compatible).
